## 260. Single Number III

- [Link to LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii/)

**Description:**



Given an integer array `nums`, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once. You can return the answer in **any order**.

**Follow up:** Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?

### **Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,2,5]
Output: [3,5]
Explanation:  [5, 3] is also a valid answer.
```

### **Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,0]
Output: [-1,0]
```

### **Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: [1,0]
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
- `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
- Each integer in `nums` will appear twice, only two integers will appear once.
