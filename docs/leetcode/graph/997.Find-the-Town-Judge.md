## 997. Find the Town Judge

- [Link to LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-town-judge/)

**Description:**

In a town, there are `N` people labelled from `1` to `N`. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:

1. The town judge trusts nobody.
2. Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
3. There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.

You are given `trust`, an array of pairs `trust[i] = [a, b]` representing that the person labelled `a` trusts the person labelled `b`.

If the town judge exists and can be identified, return the label of the town judge. Otherwise, return `-1`.

### **Example 1:**



```
Input: N = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
Output: 2
```



### **Example 2:**



```
Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= N <= 1000`
- `0 <= trust.length <= 10^4`
- `trust[i].length == 2`
- `trust[i]` are all different
- `trust[i][0] != trust[i][1]`
- `1 <= trust[i][0], trust[i][1] <= N`

#### **Solution 1**

```java
class Solution {
    public int findJudge(int N, int[][] trust) {
        int[] degrees = new int[N]; // indegree - outdegree

        for (int[] t : trust) {
            ++degrees[t[1] - 1];
            --degrees[t[0] - 1];
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            if (degrees[i] == N - 1) return i + 1;
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
}
```
