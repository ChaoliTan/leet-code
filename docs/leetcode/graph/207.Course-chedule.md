## 207. Course Schedule

- [Link to LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/)



**Description:**



There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses-1`.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: `[0,1]`

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite **pairs**, is it possible for you to finish all courses

### **Example 1:**



```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```



### **Example 2:**



```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

**Constraints:**

- The input prerequisites is a graph represented by **a list of edges**, not adjacency matrices. Read more about [how a graph is represented](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs).
- You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
- `1 <= numCourses <= 10^5`



**Hints:**

* This problem is equivalent to finding if a cycle exists in a directed graph. If a cycle exists, no topological ordering exists and therefore it will be impossible to take all courses.
* [Topological Sort via DFS](https://class.coursera.org/algo-003/lecture/52) - A great video tutorial (21 minutes) on Coursera explaining the basic concepts of Topological Sort.
* Topological sort could also be done via [BFS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting#Algorithms).

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        // course -> prerequisite makes more sense, however it is detecting a cycle, so prerequisite -> course will also be correct.
        List<List<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; ++i)
            graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
        for (int[] pre : prerequisites) {
            int course = pre[0];
            int prereq = pre[1];
            graph.get(course).add(prereq);
        }
        
        int[] visited = new int[numCourses]; // 1: visiting, 2: visited
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; ++i)
            if (dfs(graph, visited, i)) return false;
        return true;
    }
    public boolean dfs(List<List<Integer>> graph, int[] visited, int course ) {
        if (visited[course] == 2) return false;
        if (visited[course] == 1) return true;
        visited[course] = 1;
        for (Integer pre : graph.get(course))
            if (dfs(graph, visited, pre)) return true;
        visited[course] = 2;
        return false;
    }
}
