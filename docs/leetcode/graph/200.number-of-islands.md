## 200. Number of Islands

- [Link to LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)

**Description:**

Given an `m x n` 2d `grid` map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return *the number of islands*.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

### **Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```



### **Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

- **Constraints:**
  - `m == grid.length`
  - `n == grid[i].length`
  - `1 <= m, n <= 300`
  - `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.

#### **Solution 1**

```java
class Solution {
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        int ans = 0;
        for (int y = 0; y < m; ++y) {
            for (int x = 0; x < n; ++x) {
                if (grid[y][x] == '1') {
                    dfs(grid, m, n, y, x);
                    ++ans;
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
    public void dfs(char[][] grid, int m, int n, int y, int x) {
        if (y < 0 || y >= m || x < 0 || x >= n || grid[y][x] == '0') return;
        grid[y][x] = '0';
        int[] dir = new int[]{0, 1, 0, -1, 0};
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
            int ny = y + dir[i];
            int nx = x + dir[i + 1];
            dfs(grid, m, n, ny, nx);
        }
    }
}
```
