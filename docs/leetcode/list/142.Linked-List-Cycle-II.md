## 142. Linked List Cycle II

- [Link to LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/)

**Description:**



Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return `null`.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

**Notice** that you **should not modify** the linked list.

### **Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

### **Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

### **Example 3:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
- `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

 

**Follow up:** Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?

#### **Solution 1**



> Assume fast moves two steps, and slow moves one step
>
> After slow moves **t** steps and fast moves **2t** steps, and __t = n * q && t >= (p - 1)__, we have the following equation: 
>
>  **(2t - (p - 1)) % q = (t - (p - 1)) % q**
>
>  so they will meet in the cycle if there exists a cycle.
>
> After fast and slow meet, the fastâ€™s position is **(2t - (p - 1)) % q**, then assume head and fast both move one step, 
>
> When fast and head meet, head must be on **(p - 1)**, which the cycle begins, cause after **(p - 1)**  steps, fast is on  **(2t - (p - 1) + (p - 1)) % q == 2t % q == 0** , means the starting point of the cycle.



```java
public class Solution {
    public ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
        ListNode fast = head, slow = head;
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            fast = fast.next.next;
            slow = slow.next;
            if (fast == slow) {
                while (head != fast) {
                    fast = fast.next;
                    head = head.next;
                }
                return head;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```
