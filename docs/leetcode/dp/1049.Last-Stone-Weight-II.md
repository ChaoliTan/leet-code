## 1049. Last Stone Weight II

- [Link to LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight-ii/)

**Description:**



We have a collection of rocks, each rock has a positive integer weight.

Each turn, we choose **any two rocks** and smash them together. Suppose the stones have weights `x` and `y` with `x <= y`. The result of this smash is:

- If `x == y`, both stones are totally destroyed;
- If `x != y`, the stone of weight `x` is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight `y` has new weight `y-x`.

At the end, there is at most 1 stone left. Return the **smallest possible** weight of this stone (the weight is 0 if there are no stones left.)

### **Example 1:**

```
Input: [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
We can combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,7,1,8,1] then,
we can combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we can combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we can combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the optimal value.

**Note:**

1. `1 <= stones.length <= 30`
2. `1 <= stones[i] <= 100`

#### **Solution 1**



```java
// DP
// Time Complexity: O(n*sum)
// Space Complexity: O(1)
class Solution {
   public int lastStoneWeightII(int[] stones) {
       int n = stones.length;
       int sum = 0;
       for (int stone : stones) sum += stone;
       // dp[i][j] : 表示遇到第i个石头时，j的背包容量（从1到sum/2结束），能装到石头的重量
       int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][sum / 2 + 1];
       for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
           int currStone = stones[i - 1];
           for (int j = 1; j <= sum / 2; ++j) {
               dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j]);
               if (j >= currStone) {
                   dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - currStone] + currStone);
               }
           }
       }
       return sum - 2 * dp[n][sum / 2];
   }
}
```
