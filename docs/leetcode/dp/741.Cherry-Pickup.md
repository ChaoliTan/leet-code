## 741. Cherry Pickup

- [Link to LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/cherry-pickup/)

**Description:**



You are given an `n x n` `grid` representing a field of cherries, each cell is one of three possible integers.

- `0` means the cell is empty, so you can pass through,
- `1` means the cell contains a cherry that you can pick up and pass through, or
- `-1` means the cell contains a thorn that blocks your way.

Return *the maximum number of cherries you can collect by following the rules below*:

- Starting at the position `(0, 0)` and reaching `(n - 1, n - 1)` by moving right or down through valid path cells (cells with value `0` or `1`).
- After reaching `(n - 1, n - 1)`, returning to `(0, 0)` by moving left or up through valid path cells.
- When passing through a path cell containing a cherry, you pick it up, and the cell becomes an empty cell `0`.
- If there is no valid path between `(0, 0)` and `(n - 1, n - 1)`, then no cherries can be collected.

### **Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/14/grid.jpg)

```
Input: grid = [[0,1,-1],[1,0,-1],[1,1,1]]
Output: 5
Explanation: The player started at (0, 0) and went down, down, right right to reach (2, 2).
4 cherries were picked up during this single trip, and the matrix becomes [[0,1,-1],[0,0,-1],[0,0,0]].
Then, the player went left, up, up, left to return home, picking up one more cherry.
The total number of cherries picked up is 5, and this is the maximum possible.
```

### **Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [[1,1,-1],[1,-1,1],[-1,1,1]]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 50`
- `grid[i][j]` is `-1`, `0`, or `1`.
- `grid[0][0] != -1`
- `grid[n - 1][n - 1] != -1`

#### **Solution 1**



```java
// DP 
// Time Complexity: O(n^3)
// Space Complexity: O(n^3)
class Solution {
    public int cherryPickup(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        g_ = grid.clone();
        m_ = new int[n][n][n];
        for (var arr : m_)
            for (var row : arr)
                Arrays.fill(row, Integer.MIN_VALUE);
        return Math.max(0, dp(n - 1, n - 1, n - 1));
    }
    // Max cherries from (x1, y1) to (0, 0) + (x2, x1 + y1 - x2) to (0, 0)
    private int dp(int x1, int y1, int x2) {
        int y2 = x1 + y1 - x2;
        if (x1 < 0 || y1 < 0 || x2 < 0 || y2 < 0) return -1;
        if (g_[y1][x1] < 0 || g_[y2][x2] < 0) return -1;
        if (x1 == 0 && y1 == 0) return g_[y1][x1];
        if (m_[x1][y1][x2] != Integer.MIN_VALUE) return m_[x1][y1][x2];
        int ans = Math.max(Math.max(dp(x1 - 1, y1, x2 - 1), dp(x1, y1 - 1, x2)),
                           Math.max(dp(x1, y1 - 1, x2 - 1), dp(x1 - 1, y1, x2)));
        if (ans < 0) return m_[x1][y1][x2] = -1;
        ans += g_[y1][x1];
        if (x1 != x2) ans += g_[y2][x2];
        
        return m_[x1][y1][x2] = ans;
    }
    
    private int[][][] m_;
    private int[][] g_;
}
